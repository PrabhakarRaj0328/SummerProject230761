To see the task you need to go to the index.html and open it on a live server on vs-code. This is the home page or inbox and where the e-mail list is present.If you tap on the "New-email" red button on top left corner you will see a new page where you can compose a mail with all the required fields. If you tap on any of the mail messages, the mail will open with all the information and attachments. If tapping doesn't work on the first time please tap one more time preferrably on the text of that particular mail. I have done all the 3 frontend objectives.
